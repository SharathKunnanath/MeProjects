\section{Introduction}
Given an \[n \times m\] matrix filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time


\section{Problem Statement}
Find a solution that utilizes dynamic programming to compute Minimum Cost Path in a matrix efficiently.
Write a function for both the recursive and iterative dynamic programming solution
